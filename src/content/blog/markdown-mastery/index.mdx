This post demonstrates every content element supported by this blog. Use it as a reference when writing your own posts.

## Typography Fundamentals

Good writing starts with **strong emphasis** for key concepts, *subtle italics* for nuance, and `inline code` for technical terms like `useState` or `async/await`.

Paragraphs should flow naturally. The serif typography and relaxed line-height are optimized for long-form reading. Notice how the text wraps elegantly within the 65-character measure—wide enough for comfortable reading, narrow enough to prevent eye fatigue.

### The Art of Quotation

Quotes add authority and break up dense technical content:

> "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
>
> <cite>Arthur C. Clarke</cite>

Use blockquotes sparingly for maximum impact. They work best for memorable insights or foundational principles.

## Code Examples

Code blocks feature syntax highlighting, a copy button, and language labels:

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the nth Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

# Example usage
for i in range(10):
    print(f"F({i}) = {fibonacci(i)}")
```

Here's a JavaScript example for comparison:

```javascript
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
  let timeoutId;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
};

// Usage with search input
const handleSearch = debounce((query) => {
  console.log(`Searching for: ${query}`);
}, 300);
```

Inline code like `npm install` or `git commit -m "message"` blends naturally with prose.

## Visual Content

Images are automatically optimized and styled:

## Data Presentation

Tables are perfect for structured comparisons:

| Framework | Language | Stars | Learning Curve |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :---: |
| React | JavaScript | 220k | Moderate |
| Vue | JavaScript | 207k | Gentle |
| Svelte | JavaScript | 77k | Easy |
| Angular | TypeScript | 95k | Steep |

**Table 1:** Popular frontend frameworks compared by GitHub stars and relative learning difficulty.

For power users, here's how to customize the build process:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "target": "esnext",
    "minify": true,
    "sourcemap": false,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  }
}
```

Remember to test thoroughly after making configuration changes.

## Rich Media

Embed YouTube videos with deferred loading for optimal performance:

<LiteYouTube videoid="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Never Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley" />

The video thumbnail loads immediately, but the full player only initializes when clicked—saving bandwidth and improving page speed.

## Research & Citations

Academic writing benefits from proper footnotes[^1]. They keep the main text clean while providing rigorous attribution[^2].

You can reference multiple sources in a single statement when synthesizing research findings[^3].

[^1]: Footnotes appear at the bottom of the article, styled distinctly from body text.

[^2]: This approach follows established academic conventions while maintaining web readability.

[^3]: Multiple citations demonstrate thorough research and strengthen arguments.

## Conclusion

This post covered the complete range of content elements:

- **Typography**: Bold, italic, inline code
- **Structure**: Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes
- **Code**: Syntax-highlighted blocks with copy functionality
- **Media**: Optimized images with captions
- **Data**: Responsive tables with captions
- **Interactive**: Task lists, collapsibles
- **Embeds**: Deferred YouTube loading
- **Citations**: Footnotes for references

Use these building blocks to craft compelling technical content. The design system ensures visual harmony regardless of which elements you combine.
